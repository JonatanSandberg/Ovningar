    <h1>ITALO CALVINO</h1>
    <h2><span style="font-style: italic;">“Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.”</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Italo Calvino</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Invisible Cities</span></h2>

      
      

    <p>The bookstore in your neighborhood sits on a busy corner. You pass it on your walk to work in the mornings, and on your walk home in the evenings, and although you sometimes admire the clever geometries of its window display, rarely do you take a closer look. But, not long ago, the sight of a particular book made you pause.</p> <p>Your eye lingered on its pure-white cover and on a curious shape cut into it. Without thinking, you walked into the store. The clerk was working at her computer. The other customers were leafing through books lifted from the great pyramids of new releases on the front table. No one paid any attention to you.</p>
      <p>You reached for the book you had spotted. The author was Italo Calvino, whose name conjured up some vague impressions—an Italian who had risen to prominence after the Second World War, a writer of stories within stories. With your thumb, you flipped through the first few pages and, with the practiced efficiency of someone who never has enough time, you determined what the book was about.</p> <p>It was a book called “The Castle of Crossed Destinies,” about men and women who, having been mysteriously struck dumb, were using packs of tarot cards to describe the adventures that had befallen them. Or it was a book called “Invisible Cities,” in which the Venetian merchant Marco Polo described to Kublai Khan the far-away lands of his empire, and, as you turned the pages, the spires and domes of unreal cities rose and fell before your eyes.</p>
    <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">My three favourite novels by Calvino:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-style: italic;">Le città invisibili / Invisible Cities</li>
      <li style="font-style: italic;">Se una notte d'inverno un viaggiatore / If on a winter's night a traveler</li>
      <li style="font-style: italic;">Palomar / Mr. Palomar</li>
    </ul>
